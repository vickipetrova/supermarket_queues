# Supermarket Queues üõíüõçÔ∏è

Apply queuing theory and built a simulation to find the optimal number of cashiers at a grocery store. 

## What I learned?
- Python
- OOP 
- Theoretical analysis using the math formulas behind queuing theory
- Empirical analysis by creating various graphs and inferring information from them
- Problem definition to build a model in terms of the set of rules, assumptions, and variables
- Implement the model in a Python simulation 
- Data visualization and analysis
- Error plots, confidence intervals
